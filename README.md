# Dynamic Local Feature Aggregation for Learning on Point Clouds
This repository contains PyTorch implementation for DFA : **Dynamic Local Feature Aggregation for Learning on Point Clouds.** 
Our code skeleton is borrowed from antao97/dgcnn.pytorch

Our DFA module is as follows:

We use DFA to complete the point cloud classification and segmentation task structure as follows:
